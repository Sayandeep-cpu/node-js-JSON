Shadow falls gently over the hills where silence whispers secrets to the trees and 
twilight gathers memories from the sky clouds drift slowly across the aching blue a
bove a field of golden stillness while the wind traces patterns through the tall grass 
dreams echo through the stones beneath our feet telling tales of time forgotten and light
once cherished the river speaks in rhythm soft and endless winding its song through valley
s of evergreen hush stars wait behind a curtain of dusk ready to spill their stories to anyone
who listens fireflies pulse with ancient signals their glow a language older than words paths
bend and blur into the distance fading behind the hush of the present moment leaves rustle
like murmured thoughts shifting with each gust from unseen corners of the earth night falls
 not with a cry but a breath long and low and full of promise somewhere a window glows softly  a lighthouse for tired souls the owl calls out once its voice a compass for the dark branches   stretch like arms reaching for forgotten moons whose names lie buried in myth the ground hums    low a lullaby spun from roots and soil and rain stones remember footsteps even when we forget
 whre we have wandered nothing truly disappears only changes form in the great unfolding tapestry
of hours mist coils around old fences dissolving edges and making everything possible again a dog 
barks far off as if answering a question the stars never stop asking fences creak and sigh with 
stories stored in rust and wood and waiting minutes tick by soft as feathers falling through a deep 
quiet lake the scent of something baked drifts through the air like an invitation to come back home 
to where laughter once lived behind every breeze is a memory unopened the sky yawns in twilight orange
and lavender spilling its last breath over sleeping towns the hush of a distant train bends through 
the air like a note not yet resolved slow moments are the ones that matter the most even if 
they pass unnoticed a single moth circles a bulb in infinite pilgrimage its wings brushing electric 
silence every object holds a history every breeze a suggestion of what once was or might still be dust s
ettles not just on shelves but on yesterday itself people pass one another not knowing they were once th
e same dream in someone else's mind the streetlights blink into being one by one soft sentinels of neon p
atience puddles reflect constellations that no longer match the sky above memories seep into brick walls 
and alley corners shaping the way we walk in silence laughter from somewhere distant reminds us we were not 
always this tired clocks move whether we look at them or not footsteps vanish but echoes stay curled in the 
quiet corners of a hallway paper crinkles somewhere behind a closed door someone writing their own kind of
poem that may never be read birds sing even in the dark hoping the sun still listens shoes wait by doors f
or journeys never taken moth-eaten scarves hang like whispered winters on coat hooks untouched dust swirls
in sunbeams like tiny galaxies of the forgotten glass bottles hold the last breath of celebrations long g
one ivy creeps slowly swallowing fences as if erasing boundaries we once thought mattered keys jingle on 
forgotten hooks unfit for locks that rusted long ago words linger in journals half-written held by spines
 that no longer open light through blinds makes patterns only seen by the still the hum of the refrigerat

 iggles even empty chairs remember weight and warmth and grief radios hiss between stations grasping for 
voices that faded decades ago old coins on windowsills mark promises not quite kept sweaters in drawers 
still carry the scent of distant campfires unanswered letters sleep beneath beds with thoughts too late 
to send mirrors remember faces long after reflections fade shadows gather in corners not to haunt but to
witness the slow bloom of dust upon forgotten shoes wind chimes tangle in each other like thoughts on s
leepless nights unopened gifts know the shape of surprise and the absence that followed curtains sway w

ll paint fades like memories bleached by timeâ€™s patient brush the television screen stares blankly refl
ecting no one but us when we look long enough rooftops sigh with the weight of rain never spoken aloud each 
creak of the floorboards is a line in a quiet autobiography coat zippers echo like tiny lightning through 
quiet mornings the fridge hum harmonizes with the clink of cups from shelves dreaming of use warm air from vents 
tells secrets to dust bunnies hiding underneath thoughts hang in air like steam rising from mugs untouched tables 
are stages for meals never served the ceiling above our bed is a vast scroll of what-ifs and maybes lights
